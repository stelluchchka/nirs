# laszip-python

Unofficial bindings between [Python][python-site] and [LASzip][laszip-github] made
using [pybind11][pybind11-github].

The main purpose is for integration within [laspy][laspy-github].

# Building

Building can be done using cmake or pip.

First, `laszip` and `pybind11` needs to be installed. You can install it via `vcpkg` or `conda` or other means.

To help cmake find Laszip you may have to use `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/some/path/vcpg.cmake`
if you used vcpkg to install laszip, or `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PARTH`
(or `-DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=...` and `-DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=...` in rare cases).


As setup.py calls cmake the same options make need to be given:
```shell
set -gx SKBUILD_CMAKE_ARGS -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=...
pip install .
```
